In this Exercise you are asked to implement simple search engine based on Gabor's filter. Gabor's filter is a linear filter used for texture analysis. It can be applied to an image to detect specyfic frequency content (pattern). This involves different frequencies as well as the sizes of this content. Gabor's filter is a Gaussian kernel function modulated by a sinusoidal wave. Look at the below figures. They illustrate several Gabor's filters which are different with repect to the orientation (angle) and the frequency. You may change the values of angles and freqs arrays and run the script again to see the results. However, restore their original values for the remainder of this exercise. "
